# mod_twitter for Joomla 3.0

## Note
This code is UNTESTED and MAY NOT WORK just yet.

Just a simple Twitter widget for use with the Joomla CMS.

My biggest issue with the other twitter modules on the market is that they're trying too hard.  This module won't integrate with every other social network feed on the planet.  It won't drown you in options.  It will draw you a simple feed of tweets from a Twitter account of your choosing.  It will also transform links, @usernames and #hashtags into links.

# Features

* Simple setup
* Easy to modify
* Free
* Display tweets by @username
* Display tweets by #hashtag, or #multiple #hashtags
